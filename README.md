:exclamation: **Attention** This is an early experimental version of the game, and still has several bugs and missing features. Just for testing since it is not playable yet (maybe in a  few months?).

Features
----
  - Play singleplayer duels
  - With more than 20 different cards (of 4 different elemental types)
